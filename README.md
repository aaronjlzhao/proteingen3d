# Advanced Antibody–Antigen 3D Simulation Project

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing antibody–antigen interactions in 3D using Python, Biopython, and Py3Dmol. It includes residue-level interaction detection, paratope–epitope mapping, and in silico mutagenesis—all visualized with molecular viewers and bipartite contact graphs.

## Features

- Automatic detection of heavy chain, light chain, and antigen chains from PDB structure
- 3D visualization of antibody–antigen complexes using `py3Dmol` and `nglview`
- Highlighting of CDR loops and epitopes
- Detection of van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds
- Extraction of paratope and epitope residues
- In silico alanine scanning (e.g., Tyr52 → Ala)
- Visual comparison of wild-type and mutant structures
- Epitope–paratope bipartite contact map (NetworkX)
